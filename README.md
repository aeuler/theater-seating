# Theater Seating Program

Welcome to my Java Project!

In this project, I have designed a theater seating app with Java that allows the user to obtain a ticket by location, best seat, or price.

This program can be asked of a typical java developer or used as a project for an intro to cs course.

Drafted by Andrew Euler.
